# Progress
Although completely a WIP, the progress can be seen below:
- [x] make concept
- [ ] make extension base
- [ ] code the main js file
- [ ] put it together
- [ ] get it on chrome webstore
- [ ] upload source here!!
# Downloading and Installing
It's best to use the CRX with dev mode on, the CRX files can be found in the releases. If dev mode is not an option, you may use the chrome webstore version, although this version is prone to being banned.
